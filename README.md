If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

ONLYOFFICE Document Server is an online office suite comprising viewers and editors for texts, spreadsheets and presentations, fully compatible with Office Open XML formats: .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and enabling collaborative editing in real time.

Online collaborative edition of ONLYOFFICE documents requires: 
1. a server part, with two installation options:
   1. ONLYOFFICE Document Server packaged for YunoHost. 
   2. The [Community Document Server for Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/documentserver_community) 

2. a client part, such as: 
   1. The [ONLYOFFICE connector for Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/onlyoffice) 
   2. The [ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors](https://www.onlyoffice.com/fr/download-desktop.aspx)

A solution made easy by YunoHost is to install (1.i) and (2.i), see [section below](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/onlyoffice_ynh/#configuration-of-onlyoffice-server). The Nextcloud addicts may follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/nextcloud_ynh#configure-onlyoffice-integration) to install (1.ii) and (2.i) on one Nextcloud instance. However, performance and architecture are limited.


**Shipped version:** 7.3.2~ynh1

## Disclaimers / important information

## Demo

* A free 30 days demo of Document Server is available from ONLYOFFICE connector for Nextcloud:
  * Install Nextcloud and the ONLYOFFICE app (connector).
  * Go in the Nextcloud administrator settings, section ONLYOFFICE.
  * Tick the box `Connection to demo ONLYOFFICE Document Server` in Server Parameters.
* Some testing is also possible using [ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editor](https://www.onlyoffice.com/fr/download-desktop.aspx).

## Prerequisite

You should not install ONLYOFFICE on your main YunoHost domain, especially if you want to use it with a Nextcloud installed on the same domain.
* Add a new domain for ONLYOFFICE in YunoHost.
  * If your main YunoHost domain was provided by YunoHost, e.g. `domain.nohost.me`, then you don't have to buy/register a new domain name.
  * Just click on `I already have a domain`.
  * Type e.g. `office.domain.nohost.me` and click on `Add`.
* Add a Let's Encrypt certificate for this domain.

## Configuration of ONLYOFFICE Server

* Assuming that:
  * `yunohost.domain` is your main YunoHost domain.
  * You have configured `office.yunohost.domain` for ONLYOFFICE, see Prerequisite above.
  * You have Nextcloud installed on `yunohost.domain/nextcloud` or `nextcloud.yunohost.domain`.
* Install `ONLYOFFICE` using CLI or webadmin.
  * Choose a domain name for ONLYOFFICE that is different from your Nextcloud domain, e.g. `office.yunohost.domain` (or `office.domain.nohost.me`, see previous section).
  * Choose a path for ONLYOFFICE, e.g. `/` if you install on `office.yunohost.domain` (do not install any other app on this domain).
  * The domain of your Nextcloud instance, e.g. `yunohost.domain/nextcloud` or `nextcloud.yunohost.domain`.
  * Is it a public application? **If you want to connect it to Nextcloud, ONLYOFFICE should be public**: then select `Yes` or `tick the box`.
